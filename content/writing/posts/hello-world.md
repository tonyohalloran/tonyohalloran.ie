summary: "A brief introduction and why I'm starting to write more."

This is a placeholder post to test the site. I'll replace this with real writing soon.

## Why Write?

I've been meaning to write more for years. Working in AI research means I'm constantly thinking through complex problems, reading papers, and forming opinions on where the field is heading. Most of that thinking stays in my head or in scattered notes.

This site is an attempt to change that. Writing forces clarity. If I can't explain something simply, I probably don't understand it well enough.

## What to Expect

I'll write about:

- **AI research** — what I'm working on, papers I find interesting, trends I'm watching
- **RL and agents** — the focus of my work at Andromede
- **AI governance** — something I think about a lot at Pivotal Research
- **Other things** — cycling, books, whatever else seems worth sharing

No fixed schedule. I'd rather write when I have something to say than force out content for its own sake.
