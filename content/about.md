<div class="intro">

I'm an AI researcher based in Ireland, working on reinforcement learning, AI governance, and applications of AI for global health.

</div>
</div>

I'm currently a **Founding Research Scientist at [Andromede AI](https://andromede.ai)**, where we're building realistic RL environments for training agents in the real world. I'm also a **Research Fellow at [Pivotal Research](https://pivotal-research.org)**, investigating how distributed "dark-compute" training runs can slip past governance caps and modeling ways to detect them.

Previously, I worked at the intersection of AI and global health — completing my MSc thesis at **LiGHT** (a collaboration between EPFL, Harvard Chan/BWH-Ariadne, and CMU-Africa), hosting the **LiGHTCAST Podcast** on AI breakthroughs in humanitarian response, and contributing as an AI researcher to the **International Committee of the Red Cross**.

Outside of research, I'm a cyclist, a longtime volunteer with the **European Youth Parliament**, and an occasional debater (Irish Times Debate finalist, 2021).
