I'm an AI researcher based in Girona, Spain.

I'm a **Founding Research Scientist at [Andromede](https://andromede.ai)**, building realistic RL environments for training agents in the real world.

I was a **[Pivotal Research Fellow](https://www.pivotal-research.org/)**, investigating how covert distributed training runs can evade compute governance and how to detect them, mentored by Peter Barnett (MIRI).

Before that, I completed my **MSc in AI at University of Galway** (Best Thesis Award), with thesis research at the **[Yale/EPFL LiGHT Lab](https://www.light-research.ai/)** on modular neural networks for datasets with systematic missingness. I also hosted the **LiGHTCAST** podcast on AI for global health.

Earlier, I was Applied AI Lead at Verodat, worked on growth at Evervault (Sequoia/Index-backed), and co-founded TY.ie (acquired 2017).

I studied Mathematics at University College Cork and UC Santa Barbara.
