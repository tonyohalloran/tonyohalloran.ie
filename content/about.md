<div class="intro">

I'm an AI researcher based in Ireland, working on machine learning, AI safety, and applications of AI for global health.

</div>
</div>

I'm currently completing my **MSc in Artificial Intelligence at University of Galway** while doing thesis research at the **Yale/EPFL Laboratory of Intelligent Global Health Technologies (LiGHT)**, where I'm building modular neural networks for large-scale datasets with systematic missingness.

I also serve as an **Associate Editor for Nature Digital Medicine**, reviewing papers and coordinating teams of reviewers each month.

Previously, I was **Applied AI Lead at Verodat**, building robust AI applications, and worked on growth and analytics at **Evervault**, a Sequoia and Index Ventures-backed encryption platform. Earlier, I co-founded **TY.ie**, a platform for Irish students that was acquired in 2017.
